# Cardle

A [wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and [worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/) inspired game where users try and guess the automobile manufacturer.

Built using mostly Vanilla JS and CSS.

### notes

- currently no api to give me 100% what I want.
- If a 'hard mode' is implemented, I'll definitely make an api call without regards to some of the more obscure brands.
