# [Cardle](https://0xcire.github.io/new_cardle/)

A [wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and [worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/) inspired game where users try and guess the automobile manufacturer.

## Built With

- HTML5 / CSS3
- JavaScript
- MVC Pattern

## Learning Points

- Working with Web Animation API
- Modern JS features that are commonly used in React.
   - Referencing [this](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/javascript-to-know-for-react) article from Kent C Dodds.
- Promise.all([]) for making multiple API requests that are non-dependent on each other

### issues

- Using Haversine's Formula for calculating bearing angle is inaccurate for long distances. Accurate for shorter ones.

## future plans

- Currently making more traditional web apps with MERN Stack.
 - Once comfortable will likely come back and use this as first project in serverless architecture. T3 stack with database.js potentially. 
- Create custom API as none exist to serve needs for this app.
- Use OpenCage geocoding instead of OpenWeather's
- map to visualize guesses although this might make it too easy
